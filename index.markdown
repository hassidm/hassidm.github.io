Hi there, I'm Michael.

I am a (fourth-year) computer sceince PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il" target="_blank">HUJI</a>), and a reserach assistant at FAIR (<a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/" target="_blank">Meta AI</a>). Both are part of an excellence joint program between HUJI and Meta AI, under the guidance of <a href="https://schwartz-lab-huji.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Roy Schwartz</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~adiyoss/" target="_blank">Dr. Yossi Adi</a>.

My primary focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs), where I'm particularly interested in making them more efficient and accessible. A significant part of my research involves investigating neural mechanisms for LLMs. I also enjoy exploring LLMs for reasoning, code generation, and mathematics, and I'm quite interested in speech language models (SLMs) and working with multimodal data.

Before this, I spent almost four years at Google (<a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank">Search Console</a> and <a href="https://research.google/" target="_blank">Google research</a>) as a software engineer and researcher (across part-time and full-time internships). My academic background includes both a B.Sc. (<b>summa cum laude</b>, "Amirim" excellence program) and an M.Sc. (<b>magna cum laude</b>, excellence program) in Computer Science from HUJI.

Other than that, I consider my marriage to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6apvstwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Miri Varshavsky (now also) Hassid</a>  to be my greatest personal achievement. I also occasionally participating in spoken word performances.
